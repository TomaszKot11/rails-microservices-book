## What's in This Book?

This book has several sections. First, we'll discuss the Ruby on Rails framework. Then we'll walk through building a basic Rails website. We'll add login functionality. We'll then build an image processing module. We'll watch our application gain popularity, which will require refactorizations. We'll split the image processing module out into its own service, exploring JSON endpoints vs the ActiveRemote gem. Along the way, you'll also learn a few Docker Compose commands to quickly get your services up and running.
