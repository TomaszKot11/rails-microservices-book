### Chapter 14 - Summary

A microservice architecture is a journey, not a destination. As your platform grows, you will have the flexibility to scale the parts of the system that grow at a faster pace. Writing some or all of your microservices in Ruby on Rails using the gems and messaging systems that we've discussed will allow you to quickly spin up new microservices to meet your business needs.

The learning does not stop here! Spin up a proof of concept project, get involved in a local software development user group and contribute to this book. As technologists, we're all on similar journeys, doing something we love and at the same time helping our businesses grow. My hope is that this book has taken the mystery out of microservices and will help you design and implement your own scalable platform.
