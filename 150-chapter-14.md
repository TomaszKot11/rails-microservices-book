### Chapter 14 - Summary

Thank you for coming with me on this journey of *Building Distributed Rails Applications.* I hope you had as much fun reading as I did writing this book. My hope is that this book has taken the mystery out of building distributed services and can help you design and implement your own scalable platform.

In this book, we've discussed a microservice architecture, serialization, messaging systems and different ways to share data. We've built microservices using the Ruby on Rails framework, which allowed us to quickly spin up new applications with just a few terminal commands. We've used open-sourced gems that allow our applications to be easily configured and share data using both real-time and event-driven patterns. With this architecture, you will have the flexibility to scale the parts of the system that grow at a faster pace or require additional computing resources.

The learning does not stop here! Spin up a proof of concept project at work, get involved in a local user group and contribute to this or other documentation. As technologists, we're all on similar journeys, doing something we love and at the same time building our businesses.
