## Acknowledgements

I'd first like to thank my wife, Monica for her patience and understanding when I pursue my hobbies such as writing.

Special thanks goes to Chris Miller who has been my Ruby on Rails mentor over the course of several job changes. I'd also like to thank Igor Morgunov and Naoto Suzuki for their feedback and contributions to this book.
