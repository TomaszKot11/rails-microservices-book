## Monoliths vs microservices vs function as a service

First, a few definitions:

* **API:** Application programming interface - in the context of this book, an application that provides access to its data. An API provides application-to-application communication.
* **Services:** A service, loosely defined, is a stand-alone application that provides some piece of functionality. Examples include a website, an API, a database, etc.
* **Microservices:** A small application that provides specific functionality and data.
