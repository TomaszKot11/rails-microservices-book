## Monoliths vs microservices vs function as a service

First, a few definitions:

* **Monolith:** A single application that provides all or a large portion of the functionality your company requires.
* **API:** Application programming interface - in the context of this book, an application that provides access to its data. An API provides application-to-application communication.
* **Services:** A service, loosely defined, is a stand-alone application that provides some piece of functionality. Examples include a website, an API, a database, etc.
* **Microservices:** An application that provides specific functionality and data.

When you're first designing a service, the requirements usually start out small. As time goes on, you and your team add features and the application grows organically into a larger system. We call this a monolith. There is nothing wrong with monoliths, as long as they can handle the processing load. Monoliths are the simplest architecture because they are easy to maintain by small teams, all of the code is in one place, and communication between modules is instantaneous (no network overhead).
