### Chapter 1

## Setup

Before we can dive into building our distributed environment, we'll first need to set up our development environment. We'll use Docker to quickly get up and running. Docker also provides an networking environment that we'll use that won't interfere with already running processes on your development machine.

## Install Docker

If you're using Windows or macOS, download and install Docker Desktop. Download links and instructions can be found here: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop.

We'll also be using Docker Compose to run several applications from a single configuration file. Docker Compose is included in Docker Desktop for macOS and Windows. If you're running Linux, you'll need to install Docker separately and then follow the Docker Compose installation instructions found here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install.
